title: Jason LeMoine - Web Developer

<main class="intro">
  <p>
    Hi there. My name is Jason LeMoine, and I'm a web developer living on beautiful Bainbridge Island just across the Puget Sound from Seattle. I am not a urologist. Sorry, that's the other
    guy. While I'm not any help in that “area,” if you need some web work done, we may be able to work something out. I prefer to focus on <b>JavaScript</b> and the <b>front-end</b>, but I've also done <b>full-stack</b>. Check out my <a class="js-outbound" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlemoine">LinkedIn</a> and <a class="js-outbound" href="https://www.github.com/notaurologist">GitHub</a> profiles for more info.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not working, I'm usually trying to climb or hike or do other outdoorsy things with <a class="js-outbound" href="http://www.elizabethlemoine.com" title="Elizabeth LeMoine Photography">my gorgeous and talented wife</a> and our dog Ruby—they're
    both amazing. That's Ruby and me at the Skaha Bluffs in Penticton, BC. It's a very gneiss place to climb.
